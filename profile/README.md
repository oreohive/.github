## hey!

# we are the oreohive.

we are an **incredibly small team** of complete noobs trying to build up a p**ublicly accessible** hub for documentation, assets, resources and learning tools for a **variety of topics** that **interest us.**

# what we may end up spanning
this is ultimately subject to change, but we plan to expand into the following areas with subdomains:

### oreohive for education
- edu.oreohive.org - this will be a very important place for us. this will be where we'll publish freely accessible GCSE and A-Level revision resources, engineered to be accessible and accommodating of all minds.

###  oreohive labs
- labs.oreohive.org - this will be the home of our documentations surrounding homelab and such diy solutions, along with any programming, development, or 3D printing projects that we may tackle! any such things shall live here.

### human.oreohive.org
- human.oreohive.org - this will be a place for more 'human' resources, like ethical debates and dilemmas, much of our political thoughts and ideas, and ways we could all perhaps help influence a better world, even if they're small.

  this domain will contain resources about education and may address topics that some may consider sensitive.

  think pshe education, but hopefully at least a little less boring.

### more subdomains are planned, but are less concretely so, so we shan't detail them here just yet.


# we're growing

this project is incredibly new, and we're still getting to work just laying our foundations of what we want the beehive to be.

however, we would ABSOLUTELY appreciate your contributions, be they ideas or advice for our development.

our repositories, right now, are private; we intend to publicise them as soon as reasonably... reasonable, but as we say, certain crucial foundations of this operation have yet to be laid, and we want our community contributions to be in line with our own visions.

we think it would be unfair of us to accept too much in the way of community contributions without specifying where we want to take the beehive — in terms of design, wording, layouts, logic, and structure.

we are a tiny team of only one real programmer, so please bear with us while we get things off the ground!

thank you ever so much for stopping by, and we hope to see you soon :))
